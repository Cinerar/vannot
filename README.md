Video Annotation Tool

Web-based tool for labeling and annotation of video frames. The tool allows for the definition of one or more labels and vector or raster based annotation of single video frames. The tool relies on image processing techniques such as grab-cut to assist in obtaining the initial annotation which can then be further refined using manual editing tools. Fully annotated frames can be downloaded or persisted server-side. Capabilities can be accessed via external applications as a Javascript library.
